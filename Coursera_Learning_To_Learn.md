What is a chunk?
Chunking is the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning.
The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember, and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger picture of what you’re learning.
 
 
How to form a chunk?
 
1-Focus your attention on what you want to chunk (no tv, email, phone etc).


2-Understand the basic idea of what you are trying to chunk (figure out the main idea).
Test yourself to make sure you can solve the problem (chunk) you think you understand, this will help speed up your learning of the larger subject.
Just because you understand it doesn’t mean that you can actually do it.  Test yourself!
Only by doing it yourself helps create the neural patterns that underlie true mastery.
 
3-Gaining context so you can not just how, but also when to use this chunk.
Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly, repeating and practicing with both related and unrelated problems so that you can see not only when to use the chunk but when not to use it.
 
Chunks are best built with focused attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help you gain mastery and a sense of the big picture context.
Those are the essential steps in making a chunk and fitting that chunk into a greater conceptual overview of what you’re learning.

With worked out solutions / walkthrough solutions, most of the details of the worked out solution are right there for you to see.  It is your job to figure out why the steps are taken the way they are. They can help you see the key features and underlying principles of the problem.
Don’t focus too much on why a particular step works and not on the connection between steps or why this particular step is the next thing you should do.
***********************************   ****************************   *******************************************
 
 
Learning must take place in two different ways:

Bottom up learning (chunking) & Top down learning (big picture).
The bottom up / chunking process is where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily access it whenever you need to.
The top down / big picture process allows you to see what you’re learning and where it fits into the larger scale of the topic being learned.

Both processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material being learned.
 
**************************************************************************************************************
 
 
Recall-
	After you’ve read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you’ve just read. Repeat this, read it again and look away, see what you can recall.
The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning and helps to begin forming chunks.
Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make your study time more focused and effective.
 
Illusions of Competence-
	Having the material / notes / problem and solution in front of you can give you the illusion that it is also in your brain but it is not, because it can be easier to look at the book instead of recalling, students persist in their illusions studying in a way that isn’t very effective.
Just because you spend a lot of time with the material doesn’t guarantee you’ll actually learn it.
Keep testing yourself on what you are learning to avoid the illusion of competence.
 
Mini Testing-
	Recalling material when you are outside of your usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material. Example: instead of solving algorithms using your text editor and running them in your ide, try solving them on paper in another room.
 
Value of making mistakes-
	When you make a mistake in what you are doing, it is a good thing as it shows you where you need to focus on the problem, where you need to keep learning the topic.
Your mistakes allow you to make repairs to your thinking flaws, bit by bit, mistakes help you correct your thinking, so that you can learn better and do better.

Serotonin affects social life and risk taking behavior.
 
 
Chunks can help you understand new concepts through a process called transfer.
 
-----------------------
 
Be wary of repetitive overlearning during a single session. This can be a waste of valuable learning time.
Once you have the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn’t strengthen the kinds of long term memory connections you want to have strengthened.
Using a subsequent study session to repeat what you’re trying to learn is just fine and often valuable. It can strengthen and deepen your chunked neuron patterns.
But be wary; repeating something you already know perfectly well, is… easy (and not learning).
You should balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find more difficult.
This focusing on the more difficult material is called deliberate practice, this is what is often the difference between a good student and a great student.
 
Einstellung:
In this phenomenon, your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind or a neural pattern you’ve already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or solution from being found. It can sometimes be all-too-easy to take a wrong approach about problem solving or understanding a concept, because sometimes your initial intuition about what’s happening or what you need to be doing is misleading.
 
Interleaving:
Once you have the basic idea of the technique down during your study session, start interleaving your practice with problems of different types or different types of approaches, concepts, procedures. Try to mix up your learning, try to make it fun.
Interleaving your studies, making it a point to review for a test, for example, by skipping around through problems in the different chapters and materials can sometimes seem to make your learning a little more difficult but in reality, it helps you learn more deeply.
Interleaving is extraordinarily important.
Although practice and repetition is important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it’s interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity.
 
Summing up week 2:

Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through use and often through meaning.
Chunks are best built with focused, undivided attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help deepen your patterns and to help you gain big picture context.

Simple Recall, trying to remember the key points without looking at the page, is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along. It builds neural hooks to help you better understand the material. Try recalling materials in places that are different from the places where you originally learned the material, so it becomes more deeply ingrained and accessible, regardless of what room you’re in.
 
Transfer is the idea that a chunk you’ve mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different areas that can share surprising commonalities.
Interleave your learning by practicing your choice of different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session.
 
Illusions of competence:
Keep testing yourself to ensure that you are actually learning!
Minimize highlighting (no more than 1 sentence at a time).
Mistakes are good! They help you learn!
Use deliberate practice! Don’t practice the easy stuff only!
Keep testing yourself so you don’t have the illusion that you’ve mastered the material!
 
Einstellung is when your initial thought, an idea you’ve already had in mind, or a neural pattern you’ve already developed well and strengthened, prevents a better idea or solution from being found. Or keeps you from being flexible enough to accept new, better, or more appropriate solutions.

The law of serendipity is helpful - lady luck favors the ones who try.
Just pick one tiny thing out to learn, learn it well, then repeat this step.
