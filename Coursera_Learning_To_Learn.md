What is a chunk?
Chunking is the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning.
The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember, and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger picture of what you’re learning.
 
 
How to form a chunk?
 
1-Focus your attention on what you want to chunk (no tv, email, phone etc).


2-Understand the basic idea of what you are trying to chunk (figure out the main idea).
Test yourself to make sure you can solve the problem (chunk) you think you understand, this will help speed up your learning of the larger subject.
Just because you understand it doesn’t mean that you can actually do it.  Test yourself!
Only by doing it yourself helps create the neural patterns that underlie true mastery.
 
3-Gaining context so you can not just how, but also when to use this chunk.
Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly, repeating and practicing with both related and unrelated problems so that you can see not only when to use the chunk but when not to use it.
 
Chunks are best built with focused attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help you gain mastery and a sense of the big picture context.
Those are the essential steps in making a chunk and fitting that chunk into a greater conceptual overview of what you’re learning.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With worked out solutions / walkthrough solutions, most of the details of the worked out solution are right there for you to see.  It is your job to figure out why the steps are taken the way they are. They can help you see the key features and underlying principles of the problem.
Don’t focus too much on why a particular step works and not on the connection between steps or why this particular step is the next thing you should do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Learning must take place in two different ways:

Bottom up learning (chunking) & Top down learning (big picture).
The bottom up / chunking process is where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily access it whenever you need to.
The top down / big picture process allows you to see what you’re learning and where it fits into the larger scale of the topic being learned.

Both processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material being learned.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Recall-
	After you’ve read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you’ve just read. Repeat this, read it again and look away, see what you can recall.
The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning and helps to begin forming chunks.
Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make your study time more focused and effective.
 
Illusions of Competence-
	Having the material / notes / problem and solution in front of you can give you the illusion that it is also in your brain but it is not, because it can be easier to look at the book instead of recalling, students persist in their illusions studying in a way that isn’t very effective.
Just because you spend a lot of time with the material doesn’t guarantee you’ll actually learn it.
Keep testing yourself on what you are learning to avoid the illusion of competence.
 
Mini Testing-
	Recalling material when you are outside of your usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material. Example: instead of solving algorithms using your text editor and running them in your ide, try solving them on paper in another room.
 
Value of making mistakes-
	When you make a mistake in what you are doing, it is a good thing as it shows you where you need to focus on the problem, where you need to keep learning the topic.
Your mistakes allow you to make repairs to your thinking flaws, bit by bit, mistakes help you correct your thinking, so that you can learn better and do better.

Acetylcholine affects focused learning and attention.

Dopamine signals in relation to unexpected rewards.

Serotonin affects social life and risk taking behavior.
 
 
Chunks can help you understand new concepts through a process called transfer.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Be wary of repetitive overlearning during a single session. This can be a waste of valuable learning time.
Once you have the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn’t strengthen the kinds of long term memory connections you want to have strengthened.
Using a subsequent study session to repeat what you’re trying to learn is just fine and often valuable. It can strengthen and deepen your chunked neuron patterns.
But be wary; repeating something you already know perfectly well, is… easy (and not learning).
You should balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find more difficult.
This focusing on the more difficult material is called deliberate practice, this is what is often the difference between a good student and a great student.
 
Einstellung:
In this phenomenon, your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind or a neural pattern you’ve already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or solution from being found. It can sometimes be all-too-easy to take a wrong approach about problem solving or understanding a concept, because sometimes your initial intuition about what’s happening or what you need to be doing is misleading.
 
Interleaving:
Once you have the basic idea of the technique down during your study session, start interleaving your practice with problems of different types or different types of approaches, concepts, procedures. Try to mix up your learning, try to make it fun.
Interleaving your studies, making it a point to review for a test, for example, by skipping around through problems in the different chapters and materials can sometimes seem to make your learning a little more difficult but in reality, it helps you learn more deeply.
Interleaving is extraordinarily important.
Although practice and repetition is important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it’s interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity.
 
Summing up week 2:

Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through use and often through meaning.
Chunks are best built with focused, undivided attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help deepen your patterns and to help you gain big picture context.

Simple Recall, trying to remember the key points without looking at the page, is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along. It builds neural hooks to help you better understand the material. Try recalling materials in places that are different from the places where you originally learned the material, so it becomes more deeply ingrained and accessible, regardless of what room you’re in.
 
Transfer is the idea that a chunk you’ve mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different areas that can share surprising commonalities.
Interleave your learning by practicing your choice of different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session.
 
Illusions of competence:
Keep testing yourself to ensure that you are actually learning!
Minimize highlighting (no more than 1 sentence at a time).
Mistakes are good! They help you learn!
Use deliberate practice! Don’t practice the easy stuff only!
Keep testing yourself so you don’t have the illusion that you’ve mastered the material!
 
Einstellung is when your initial thought, an idea you’ve already had in mind, or a neural pattern you’ve already developed well and strengthened, prevents a better idea or solution from being found. Or keeps you from being flexible enough to accept new, better, or more appropriate solutions.

The law of serendipity is helpful - lady luck favors the ones who try.
Just pick one tiny thing out to learn, learn it well, then repeat this step.

Week 3 Notes:
 
In this module, we talk about two intimately connected ideas—procrastination and memory. Building solid chunks in long term memory--chunks that are easily accessible by your short term memory—takes time. This is why learning to handle procrastination is so important. Finally, we talk about some of the best ways to access your brain’s most powerful long term memory systems.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Procrastination
 
Tackling Procrastination:
It’s easier and more valuable than you think.

One technique to help with procrastination is the Pomodoro technique, which is using a timer set for 25 minutes of uninterrupted focus followed by a bit of relaxation.

When you procrastinate, you feel better - but only temporarily. In this, procrastination shares common features with addiction.
 
Habits have 4 parts:

1 The Cue
This is the trigger that launches you into zombie mode.
The cue may be something as simple as seeing the 1st item in your to do list, time to start work.
Or seeing a text message, time to stop work.
A cue by itself is neither helpful or harmful, it’s the routine, or what we do in reaction to that cue that’s what matters.
 
2 The Routine
This is the zombie mode. The routine habitual response your brain is used to falling into when it receives the cue. Zombie responses can be useful, harmless, or sometimes harmful.
 
3 The Reward
Every habit develops and continues because it rewards us. It gives us an immediate little feeling of pleasure. Procrastination is an easy habit to develop because the reward, moving your mind’s focus to something more pleasant, happens so quickly and easily.
But good habits can also be rewarded.
Finding ways to reward good study habits is important for escaping procrastination.

4 The Belief
Habits have power because of your belief in them. For example, you might feel you’ll never be able to change your habits of putting off your studies until late in the day.
To change your habit, you’ll need to change your underlying belief.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
It is perfectly normal to have negative feelings about beginning a learning session.
However, the sooner you start, the sooner you will realize that it isn’t that bad.
 
A helpful way to re-frame things is to focus on process, not product.
 
Process means the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that flow of time.
Product is an outcome, for example, a homework assignment that you need to finish.
 
To prevent procrastination, you want to avoid concentrating on product (homework assignment).


Instead, your attention should be on building processes. Processes relate to simple habits, habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done.

By focusing on process rather than product, you allow yourself to back away from judging yourself, am I getting closer to finishing? And instead, you allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work.
The key is, when a distraction arises, you want to train yourself to just let it flow by.
Setting up yourself so that distractions are minimal is a good idea (ear plugs, phone off, not much of anything that can break your concentration easily).
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You don’t want to do a full scale change of old habits.
You just want to override parts of them and develop a few new ones.
 
The trick to overriding a habit is to look to change your reaction to a cue.
The only place you need to apply willpower is to change your reaction to the cue.
 
1 The cue
Recognize what launches you into your zombie procrastination mode.
Cues usually fall into one of the four following categories:
-location
-time
-how you feel
-reactions
 
2 The Routine
Instead of diverting your attention to something less painful, this is the reaction clue where you must actively focus on rewiring your old habit.
The key to rewiring is to have a plan. Developing a new ritual can be helpful.
(set phone to do not disturb except alarms so pomodoro will work)
Settle into quiet spot where you are comfortable, not distracted so you can be super productive.
Your plan may not work at first but just keep at it, adjust the plan if necessary.
 
3 The Reward
This can sometimes need some investigation… Why are you procrastinating?
Give yourself a reward for accomplishing what you set out to do.
Remember that habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings.
It helps to add a new reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings.
 
Only once your brain starts expecting that reward will the important rewiring take place that will allow you to create new habits.
 
Remember, the better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.
 
4 The Belief
The most important part of changing your procrastination habit is the belief that you can do it!
You will find that when you get stressed, you want to fall back into the old, more comfortable habits.
Resist this! Belief that your new system works is what can get you through.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Juggling life and learning
 
 
A good way for you to keep perspective about what you are trying to learn and accomplish, is to:

Weekly List of Key Tasks
Once a week, write a brief weekly list of key tasks in a planner journal.
 
Daily “to do” List
Then each day on another page of your planner journal, write a list of the tasks that you can reasonably work on or accomplish.
Try to write this daily task list the night before. This will help your subconscious to grapple with the tasks on the list so you can figure out how to accomplish them.
Writing the list before you go to sleep, enlists your zombies, to help you accomplish the items on the list the next day.
If you don’t write your tasks down on a list, they lurk at the edge of working memory, taking up valuable mental real estate. Once you make a task list, it frees up working memory for problem solving.
Mixing other tasks in with your learning (like a physical activity) seems more enjoyable and keeps you from prolonged and unhealthy bouts of sitting.
 
Make sure you list your daily quitting time.
Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your working time.
 
Do the things on your daily to do list that you don’t want to do first (eat your frogs first).
Try to work on either the most important or most disliked task first for at least 1 pomodoro cycle first thing in the morning, it is incredibly effective.

Remember: Lady Luck favors the one who tries.
Planning well is part of trying.
Keep your eye on your learning goal, and try not to get too unsettled by occasional roadblocks.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Summing Up Procrastination:


Learning well often involves bit by bit, day by day building of solid neural scaffolds (like a weight lifter builds muscle with day to day exercise).
This is why tackling procrastination is so incredibly important.
 
Keep a planner journal so you can easily track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn’t work.

Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day.
 
Write your planned daily tasks out the night before so your brain has time to dwell on your goals and help ensure success.
 
Arrange your work into a series of small challenges.
 
Always make sure you and your zombies get lots of rewards.
Take a few minutes to savor the feelings of happiness and triumph, which also gives your brain a chance to temporarily change modes.
 
Deliberately delay rewards until you’ve finished a task.

Watch for procrastination cues.
Try putting yourself in new surroundings with few procrastination cues such as a quiet section of a library.
 
Gain trust in your new system.
You want to work hard in times of focused concentration and also to trust your system enough so that when it comes time to relax, you can actually relax without feelings of guilt or worry.

Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate. No one is perfect after all.

Eat your frogs first every day.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory
 
Diving Deeper into Memory:
 
 
To begin tapping into your visual memory system, try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember.

Part of the reason an image is so important to memory is that images connect directly to your right brain’s visual spacial centers.  The image helps you encapsulate a seemingly humdrum and hard to remember concept by tapping into visual areas with enhanced memory abilities.
The more neural hooks you can build by evoking the senses, the easier it will be for you to recall the concept and what it means.
The funnier and more evocative the images, the better.

Focusing your attention brings something into your temporary working memory, but for that something to move from working memory to long term memory, two things should happen.
1- the idea should be memorable (funny image relating it to the concept perhaps)
2- and it must be repeated, otherwise it will not be stuck into long term memory
 
Repetition is important.
Even when you make something memorable, repetition helps get that memorable item firmly lodged into long-term memory.
Remember to repeat not a bunch of times in one day but sporadically over several days.
 
Index cards can often be helpful with this.
Writing and saying what you’re trying to learn seems to enhance retention as well.
Handwriting helps you to more deeply encode, or convert into neural memory structures what you are trying to learn.
The more you can turn what you are trying to remember into something memorable, the easier it will be to recall.
You’ll want to say the word and its meaning aloud to start setting auditory hooks to the material.
After you have done this, look at the 1st side of your index card and see whether you can remember what’s on the other side of the card.
If you can’t, flip it over and remind yourself what you’re supposed to know.
If you can remember, put the card away.
Now, do something else, perhaps prepare another card and test yourself on it.
Once you have several cards together, try running through them all and even mixing them around to see if you can remember them.
This helps interleave your learning. Don’t be surprised if you struggle a bit.
Once you’ve given your cards a good try, put them away. Wait and take them out again, maybe before you go to sleep. Remember that when you sleep, your mind repeats patterns and pieces together solutions.
Briefly repeat what you want to remember over several days. Perhaps for a few minutes each morning / evening.
Gradually extend the time between the repetitions as the material firms itself into your mind.
By increasing your spacing as you become more certain of mastery, you’ll lock the material more firmly into place.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
What is Long Term Memory?
 
Astrocytes are brain cells that provide nutrients to neurons, maintain extracellular(outside the cell) ion balance, are involved in repair after injury and have a role in learning.
 
Damage to the hippocampus and its inputs leads to an inability to store new long-term memory.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique
 
Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material.
 
The memory palace technique is a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember. It involves calling to mind a familiar place, like the layout of your house, and using it as a sort of a visual notepad where you can deposit the concept images that you want to remember.
All you have to do is call to mind the place you are familiar with. Your home, your route to school or your favorite restaurant and viola in the blink of an imaginative eye, this becomes the memory palace that you’ll use as your notepad. The memory palace technique is useful for remembering unrelated items, such as a grocery list (milk, bread, eggs). To use the technique, you might imagine a  gigantic bottle of milk just inside your front door, the bread plopped on the couch and a cracked egg dribbling off of the edge of the coffee table.
In other words, you’d imagine yourself walking through a place you know well, coupled with shockingly memorable images of what you want to remember.
This approach is great for remembering lists.
In using the mind this way, memorization can become an outstanding exercise in creativity that simultaneously build neural hooks for even more creativity.
As you begin to internalize key aspects of the material, taking a little time to commit the most important points to memory, you come to understand it much more deeply.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Summing Up Memory
 
Learning to use your memory in a more disciplined yet creative manner helps you learn to focus your attention, even as you create wild diffuse connections that build stronger memories.
Here are the key ideas about memory we've covered.
 
Long Term Memory - which is like a storage warehouse.
You need to practice and repeat in order to help store items in long term memory so you can retrieve them more easily.
Practicing and repeating, all in one day, is a bad idea.
You want to extend your practice to several days.
This is why tackling procrastination is important.
It helps you build better memories, because you start earlier.
 
Working Memory - which is like a poor blackboard that quickly fades.
You can only hold about 4 items in your working memory.
When you master a technique or concept in some sense, it compacts the ideas so they can occupy less space in your working memory when you do bring them to mind.
This frees your mental thinking space so that it can more easily grapple with other ideas.

We have outstanding visual and spatial memory systems.
If you tap into those systems, it will help improve your memory.
To begin tapping into your visual memory system, try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember.
Beyond merely seeing, try to feel, to hear and even to smell something you’re trying to remember.
The funnier and more evocative the image is, the better.
As always, repetition over several days is really helpful.
 
Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material.
Try associating numbers with years or with systems you are familiar with like running times.
Many disciplines use memorable sentences to help remember things (that begin with the 1st letter of each word for example).
 
The memory palace technique, placing memorable images in a scene that is familiar to you, allows you to dip into the strength of your visual memory system, providing a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember.
 
By making meaningful groups and abbreviations, you can simplify and chunk what you’re trying to learn so you can more easily store it in memory.

And by memorizing material you understand, you can internalize the material in a profound way.
You’re reinforcing the mental library you need to become a genuine master of the material.

Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential I
 
How to Become a Better Learner

As we learn more about the brain we can become better learners, and here are two tips for how to learn better:
 
Tip # 1:
The best gift that you can give your brain is Physical Exercise.
We once thought that all of the neurons in your brain were already present at birth, but we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day. One of these places is in your Hippocampus, a brain area that is very important for learning new things that we already discussed earlier in the course.
New neurons are created to help you learn new things but they will die if you don’t use them. New experiences will rescue them. Exercise, interestingly, also helps new neurons survive. Exercise is by far more effective than any drug on the market today to help you learn better. It benefits all of your vital organisms, not just your brain.
 
Tip # 2:
Practice makes perfect, but only when your brain is prepared. There are certain critical periods in the development of your brain. When sudden improvements occur in specific abilities, expect them to happen and prepare your brain for them.
 
Practice can repair, as well as train the brain.
 
The prefrontal cortex of the brain is the part that makes plans, as well as language skills.
The prefrontal cortex is also involved in complex analysis in social behaviors, as well as decision making and planning. It is the last part of the cortex to mature. Good judgement takes a long time and a lot of experience to acquire.
Learn more about the brain here:  www.brainfacts.org
 
Summary:
 
The prefrontal cortex can influence:
People’s ability to do complex analysis
Human behavior
People’s ability to make decisions
People’s ability to plan
 
The visual cortex reaches maturation in childhood.
The prefrontal cortex is the last part of the cortex to mature (in early adulthood).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Intro to week 4
Renaissance learning and unlocking your potential Part I
 
In this section, we will learn how to:
Learn using metaphor and analogy
Work profitably with teammates
Perform well on tests
 
One important thought before proceeding to this week’s videos…
Learning doesn’t progress logically, so that each day just add an additional neat package to your knowledge shelf.
Sometimes you hit a wall in you constructing your understanding.
Things that made sense before can suddenly become confusing.
This type of knowledge collapse seems to occur when your mind is restructuring its understanding, building a more solid foundation.
Remember, it takes time to assimilate new knowledge.
You’ll inevitably go through some periods when you seem to take an exasperating step backwards, in your understanding.
This is a natural phenomenon, that means that your mind is wrestling deeply with the material.
You’ll find that when you emerge from these periods of temporary frustration, your knowledge base will take a surprising leap forward.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy
 
 
One of the best things you can do to not only remember, but understand concepts, is to create a metaphor or analogy for them. Often, the more visual, the better.
A metaphor is just a way of realizing that one thing is somehow similar to another.
As you climb to a more sophisticated understanding of whatever topic you’re concentrating on, you can revise your metaphor or toss them away and create more meaningful ones.
Metaphors and visualization, being able to see something in your mind’s eye, have been especially helpful not only in art and literature, but also in allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.
It is often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you’re trying to understand.
Metaphors and models are often vitally important in giving a physical understanding of the central idea behind the process or concept you are trying to understand.
Interestingly, metaphors and analogies are useful for getting people out of Einstellung that is, being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.
Stories, even if they are used as simple memory tricks, can also allow you to more easily retain what you are trying to learn.
Metaphors also help glue an idea into your mind, because they make a connection to neural structures that are already there.
It’s like being able to trace a pattern with tracing paper, metaphors at least help you get a sense of what’s going on.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
No Need for Genius Envy - The Imposter Syndrome
 
This is a good place for us to step back and look again at chunking from another perspective. Notice what we're doing here. We're interleaving our learning by jumping back to revisit and deepen our understanding of a topic we've already covered.
 
There's an interesting connection between learning math and science and learning a sport. In baseball, for example, you don't learn how to hit in one day. Instead, your body perfects your swing
from lots and lots of repetition over a period of years. Smooth repetition creates muscle memory,
so your body knows what to do from a single thought. One chunk instead of having to recall all the complex steps involved in hitting a ball. In the same way, once you understand why you do something in math and science. You don't have to keep re-explaining the how to yourself every time you do it. it's not necessary to go around with a hundred beans in your pocket and to lay out ten rows of ten beans again and again so you get that ten times ten is equal to 100. At some point you just know it from memory.
 
If you use the procedure a lot, by doing many different types of problems you'll find that you
understand both the why and the how behind the procedure far better than you do after getting a conventional explanation from a teacher or a book.
 
The greater understanding results from the fact that your mind constructed the patterns of meaning, rather than simply accepting what someone else has told you. Remember, people learn by trying to make sense out of the information they perceive. They rarely learn anything complex simply by having someone else tell it to them.
 
Having a somewhat smaller working memory means you can more easily generalize your learning into new, more creative combinations. Because your working memory, which grows from the focusing abilities of the prefrontal cortex doesn't lock everything up so tightly. You can more easily get input from other parts of your brain. These other areas, which include the sensory cortex, not only are more in tune with what's going on around you in the environment, but are also the source of dreams, not to mention creative ideas. You may have to work harder sometimes or even much of the time to understand what's going on. But once you get something chunked you can take that chunk and turn it outside in and inside round, putting it through creative paces even you didn't think you were capable of.
 
Here's another point to put into your mental chunker. It is practice, particularly deliberate practice on the toughest aspects of the material that can help lift average brains into the realm of those with more natural gifts. Just as you can practice lifting weights and get bigger muscles over time, you can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in your mind. Whether your naturally gifted or you have to struggle to get a solid grasp of the fundamentals, you should realize that you're not alone if you think you're an imposter. That it's a fluke when you happen to do well on a test, and then on the next test, for sure they, and your family and friends, are finally going to figure out how incompetent you really are. This feeling is so extraordinarily common that it even has a name. The Imposter Syndrome. If you suffer from these kinds of feelings of inadequacy just be aware that many others secretly share them. Everyone has different gifts, as the old saying goes, when one door closes, another opens. Keep your chin up and your eye on the open door.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life.
 
There's evidence that myelin sheaths. The fatty insulation that helps signals move more quickly along a neuron, don't finish developing in some people until they're in their twenties. This may explain why teenagers often have trouble controlling their impulsive behavior. The wiring between the intention and the control areas of the brain isn't completely formed. When you use neural circuits however, it seems you help build the myelin sheath over them. Not to mention making many other
microscopic changes.
 
Practice appears to strengthen and reinforce connections between different brain regions, creating highways between the brain's control centers and the centers that store knowledge.
 
It seems people can enhance the development of their neuronal circuits by practicing thoughts
that use those neurons. We're still in the infancy of understanding neural development. One thing is becoming clear, we can make significant changes in our brain by changing how we think.
 
Approaching material with a goal of learning it on your own, can give you a unique path to
mastery. Often no matter how good your teacher and textbook are, it's only when you sneak off and look at other books or videos that you begin to see what you learn through a single teacher, or book, is a partial version of the full three dimensional reality of the subject, which has links to still other fascinating topics that are of your choosing. Taking responsibility for your own learning is one of the most important things you can do.
 
There will always be those who criticize or attempt to undermine any effort or achievement you make. This happens to everybody. Not just Nobel Prize winners. If you do well in your studies, the people around you can feel threatened. The greater your achievement, the more other people will sometimes attack and demean your efforts. On the other hand, if you flunk a test, you also may encounter critics who throw more barbs, saying you don't have what it takes. We're often told that empathy is universally beneficial. But it's not. It's important to learn to switch on an occasional cool dispassion that helps you to not only focus on what you're trying to learn, but also to tune people out if you discover that their interests lie in undercutting you such undercutting is all too common, as people are often just as competitive as they are cooperative. When you're a young person, mastering such dispassion can be difficult. We're naturally excited about what we're working on, and we like to believe that everyone can be reasoned with and then, almost everyone is naturally good hearted towards us.
 
You can take pride in aiming for success. Because of the very things that make other
people say you can't do it. Take pride in who you are. Especially, in the qualities that make you
different. And use them as a secret talisman for success. Use your natural contrariness to defy the always present prejudices from others about what you can accomplish.

Renaissance learning and unlocking your potential Part II
 
The Value of Teamwork - Avoiding Overconfidence
 
People who have strokes can sometimes have an unusual condition known as broad-perspective perceptual disorder of the right hemisphere. People with this disorder can still function, but only partially. They can retain their intelligence, even a formidable way for solving complex math problems, if that was a skill they'd had before. But an interesting anomaly, however, is if they make a mistake in their calculations, concluding something nonsensical, such as that a hot dog stand had a, a profit and loss statement with a loss of nearly a billion dollars. It doesn't bother them. There's no big picture, click, that says, wait a minute, that answer does not make sense.
 
Although we need to be careful about faulty and superficial left brain, right brain assumptions. We also don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater, and ignore worthwhile research that gives intriguing hints about differences between the two hemispheres of the brain. There's a great deal of evidence from research that the right hemisphere helps us step back and put our work into big picture perspective. People with damage to the right hemisphere are often unable to gain ah-ha, insights. The right hemisphere, as it turns out, is vitally important in getting into the right track and doing reality checks.
 
People with strokes can remind us of the dangers of not using our full cognitive abilities, which
involve many areas of our brain. Even subtle avoidance of some of our capabilities can have a surprisingly negative impact on our work. In some sense, when you whiz through a homework or test question and don't go back to check your work, you're acting a little like a person who's refusing to use parts of your brain. You're not stopping to take a mental breath. And then revisit what you've done with the bigger picture in mind to see whether it makes sense.
 
The right hemisphere serves as a sort of devil's advocate to question the status quo and look for global inconsistencies. While the left hemisphere instead tries to cling tenaciously to the way things were.
 
Psychologist Michael Gazzaniga who posited that the left hemisphere interprets the world for us and will go to great lengths to keep those interpretations unchanging. When you work in the focus mode, it's easy to make minor mistakes in your assumptions or calculations. If you go off track early on, it doesn't matter if the rest of your work is correct. Your answer is still wrong. Sometimes, it's even laughably wrong. The equivalent of calculating a circumference of the earth that's only two and a half feet around. But these nonsensical results just don't matter to you because the more left centered focus mode has associated with it a desire to cling to what you've done. That's the problem with the focus, sometimes a bit left hemisphere leaning mode of analysis. It provides for an analytical and upbeat approach, but abundant research evidence suggests there's a potential for rigidity, dogmatism, and egocentricity. When you're absolutely certain that what you've done on a homework or test is fine, be aware that this feeling may be based on overly confident perspectives arising in part from the left hemisphere. When you step back and recheck, you're allowing for more interaction between the hemispheres, taking advantage of the special perspectives and abilities of each.
 
“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.”
-Richard Feynman
 
One of the best ways to catch your blind spots and errors is to brainstorm and work with others who are also smartly focused on the topic. It's sometimes just not enough to use more of your own neural horsepower. Both modes and hemispheres to analyze your work. After all, everyone has blind spots. You're naively upbeat focused mode can still skip right over errors, especially if you're the one who
committed the original errors. Worse yet, sometimes you can blindly believe you've got everything nailed down intellectually, but you haven't. This is the kind of thing that can leave you in shock when you discover you've flunked the test you thought you aced. By making it a point to do some of your
studying with friends, you can more easily catch where your thinking has gone astray. Friends and teammates can serve as sort of ever questioning larger scale diffuse mode outside your brain that can catch what you missed, or what you just can't see. And of course, explaining to friends helps
build your own understanding. The importance of working with others doesn't just relate to learning. It's also important in career building.
A single small tip from a teammate to take a course from the outstanding Professor Passionate, or to check out a new job opening, can make an extraordinary difference in how your life unfolds. A word of warning, however. Study groups can be powerfully effective for learning, but if study sessions turn into socializing occasions, all bets are off. Keep small talk to a minimum, get your group on track. And finish your work. If you find that your group meetings start five to 15 minutes late, members haven't read the material, and the conversation consistently veers off topic, you're best off to find another group.
 
You know your group work is going well when:
Your group meets on time (not 5 to 15 minutes late)
Your group keeps its attention on the subject until after you’ve gotten your work done.

A Test Checklist
 
Testing is itself an extraordinarily powerful, learning experience. This means that the effort you put into test-taking, including the preliminary mini test of your recall and your ability to problem solve during your preparation is of fundamental importance. If you compare how much you learn by
spending one hour studying, versus one hour taking a test on that same material, you'll retain and
learn far more as a result of the hour you spent taking a test. Testing, it seems, has a wonderful way of concentrating the mind. Virtually everything we've talked about in this course has been designed to help make the testing process seem straightforward and natural, simply an extension of the normal procedures you use to learn the material. So it's time now to cut directly to one of the final features of this course...
 
A checklist, you can use to see whether your preparation for test taking is on target. This checklist was developed by legendary educator Richard Felder. Although, it was originally developed for engineers, it's actually suitable for many disciplines. As Doctor Felder says the answer to the
question, how should I prepare for the test, is do whatever it takes to be able to answer, yes. Meaning, usually to most of the questions on this list:
 
Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
(Just hunting for relevent worked-out examples doesn't count.)
 
Did you work with classmates on homework problems or at least check your solutions with others?
 
Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution before working with classmates?
 
Did you participate actively in homework group discussions contributing ideas and asking questions?
 
Did you consult with the instructor or teaching assistants when you were having trouble with something?
 
Did you understand all your homework problem solutions when they were handed in?
 
Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions that weren't clear to you?
 
If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you
could do everything on it?
 
Did you go over the study guide and problems with classmates and quiz one another?
 
If there was a review session before the test, did you attended and asked questions about
anything you weren't sure about?
 
And lastly, did you get a reasonable night's sleep before the test?
(If your answer is no, your answers to all the preceding questions may not matter)
 
Taking a test is serious business.
Going through your own test preparation checklist can vastly improve your chances of success.
 
The answer to the question. How should I prepare for the test becomes clear once you've filled our Doctor Felder's checklist.

The Hard Start-Jump to Easy Technique
 
Now that you've gotten some insight into how your brain works, we can give you some final useful tricks that can empower your test taking.
The classic way students are taught to approach tests is to tackle the easiest problems first. This is based on the idea that by the time you finish the relatively simple problems, you'll be confident in handling the more difficult. This approach works for some people, mostly because, well, anything works for some people. Unfortunately, however, for many people it's counterproductive.
 
Tough problems often need lots of time, meaning you'd want to start on them first thing on the
test. Difficult problems can also scream for the creative powers of the diffuse mode. But to access the diffuse mode, you need to not be focusing on what you so badly want to solve.
What to do? Easy problems first, or hard?
 
The answer is to start with the hard problems but quickly jump to the easy ones. Here's what I mean.
When the test is first handed out to you, first take a quick look to get a sense of what it involves. You should do this in any case. Then, when you start working the problems, start first with what appears to be the hardest problem.
 
But steel yourself to pull away within the first minute or two, if you get stuck or you get a sense that you might not be on the right track.
 
This does something exceptionally helpful. Starting hard loads the first most difficult problem in mind and then switches attention away from it. Both these activities are what allow the diffuse mode to begin its work. If your initial work on the first hard problem has unsettled you, turn next to an easy
problem. And complete or do as much as you can. Then move, next, to another difficult looking problem and try to make a bit of progress. Again, change to something easier as soon as you feel yourself getting bogged down or stuck.
 
When you return to the more difficult problems, you'll often be pleased that the next step or steps in the problem will seem to be more obvious to you. You may not be able to get all the way to the end immediately, but at least you can get further before you switch to something else of which you can make progress.
 
The hard start jump to easy technique may make more efficient use of your brain by allowing different parts of the brain to work simultaneously on different thoughts. Using the hard start jump to easy technique on tests guarantees that you will have at least a little work done on every problem. It's also a valuable technique for helping you avoid Einstellung, getting stuck on the wrong approach - because you have a chance to look at the problem from differing perspectives.
 
The only trick with this approach is that you must have the self discipline to pull yourself off a problem once you find yourself stuck for a minute or two. For most students it's easy, for others it takes discipline and willpower. This may be why test takers sometimes find that the solution pops to mind right as they walk out the door. When they give up, their attention switched, allowing the diffuse mode the tiny bit of traction it needed to go to work and return the solution. Too late of course.
 
Sometimes, people are concerned that starting a problem and then pulling away from it might cause confusion on an examination. This doesn't seem to be a problem for most people.
But if you still have worries about whether this strategy might work for you, try it first on homework problems.

Final Helpful Hints for Tests
 
If you're a stressed out test taker, keep in mind that the body puts out chemicals such as
cortisol when it's under stress. This can cause sweaty palms, a racing heart, a knot on the pit of your stomach. But interestingly, research finds, it's how you interpret these symptoms. The story you tell yourself about why you're stressed makes all the difference.
 
If you shift your thinking from, this test has made me afraid, to this test has got me excited to do my best. It can really improve your performance. Another good tip for panicky test takers is to momentarily turn your attention to your breathing.
Relax your stomach, place your hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath. Your hand should move out, even as your whole chest is expanding outward like a barrel. By doing this type of deep breathing, you're counteracting the fight or flight response that fuels anxiety. This calms you down.
 
But don't just start this breathing on the day of the test. If you practice this breathing technique
in the weeks before, just a minute or two here or there is all it takes. You'll slide more easily into the
breathing pattern during the test. Remember, practice makes permanent. It's especially helpful deliberately moving to a deep breathing pattern in those final anxious moments before a test is handed out.

I've gotten great tips on test taking from top professors from around the world. And here are some of the best:

Cover up the answers to multiple choice questions and to try to recall the information  so you can answer the question on your own first.
 
Will the practice test be way easier than the real one? What makes the two situations different? When you do the practice test, are you at home relaxing with toons on? Taking it with a fellow student? No time limit? Did you have the answer key and class materials at hand? These circumstances are not exactly like a crowded classroom with a clock ticking away and no way to access the answers.
 
Face your fears. Often, your worst fear is not to get the grade you need for your chosen career. How can you handle this? Simple. Have a Plan B for the alternative career. Once you have a plan for the worst possible contingency, you'll be surprised that the fear will begin to subside.


Study hard up until the day of the test and then let it go. Tell yourself, oh well, let me just see how many questions I can get right. I can always pursue my other career choice. That helps release stress, so you can actually do better and get closer to your first career choice.
 
There is good worry and bad worry.
Good worry helps provide motivation and focus, while bad worry simply wastes energy. Here are a few final thoughts. The day before a test, or tests, have a quick, final look over the materials to brush up on them. You'll need both your focus mode and diffuse mode muscles, so to speak, the next day. So you don't want to push your brain too hard. You wouldn't run a ten mile race the day before running a marathon. Don't feel guilty if you can't seem to get yourself to work too hard the day before a big examination. If you prepared properly, this seems to be a natural reaction, almost as if you're subconsciously pulling back to conserve mental energy.

While taking a test, you should also remember how your mind can trick you into thinking that what you've done is correct, even if it isn't. This means whenever possible, you should blink, shift your attention, and then double check your answers using a, a big picture perspective asking yourself, does this really makes sense.

There's often more than one way to answer a question and checking your answers from different perspectives provides a golden opportunity for verifying what you've done. If there's no other way to check, except to step back through your logic, keep in mind that simple issues have tripped up even the most advanced students. Just do your best.
 
The order in which you work tests is also important. Students generally work tests from front to back. When you're checking your work if you start more towards the back and work towards the front, it sometimes seems to give your brain a fresher perspective that can allow you to more easily catch errors. Nothing's ever certain. Occasionally you can study hard and the test gods simply don't cooperate, but if you prepare well by practicing and building a strong mental library, and you approach test taking wisely, you'll find that luck will increasingly be on your side.

W4 Summary

Summing Up Module 4
 
Metaphors and analogies aren't just for art and literature. One of the best things you can do to not
only remember, but more easily understand concepts in many different fields, is to create a metaphor or analogy for them. Often, the more visual, the better.
 
If you change your thoughts, you can really, truly change your life. It seems people can enhance
the development of their neuronal circuits by practicing thoughts that use those neurons.
You can take pride in aiming for success because of the very things that make other people say you can't do it.
 
Keep in mind that when you whiz through a homework or test question and you don't go back to check your work, you're acting a little like a person who is refusing to use parts of your brain. You're not stopping to take a mental breath and then revisit what you've done with the bigger picture in mind, to see whether it makes sense.
 
Overconfidence in your results can result from using only one mode of thinking. By making it a point to do some of your studying with friends, you can more easily catch where your thinking has gone astray.
 
Going through your own test preparation checklist can vastly improve your chances of success.
 
Counterintuitive strategies such as the hard start jump to easy technique, can give your brain a chance to reflect on harder challenges even as you're focusing on other more straightforward problems.
 
The body puts out chemicals when it's under stress. How you interpret your body's reaction to those chemicals makes all the difference. If you shift your thinking from, this test has made me afraid, to this test has got me excited to do my best, it helps improve your performance.
 
If you're panicked on a test, momentarily turn your attention to your breathing. Relax your stomach, place your hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath. Your hand should move outward and your
whole chest should expand like a barrel.
 
Your mind can trick you into thinking that what you've done is correct even if it isn't. This means that whenever possible you should blink, shift your attention, and then double check your answers using a big picture perspective, asking yourself, does this really make sense?
 
Remember that not getting enough sleep the night before a test can negate any other preparation you've done.

Wrap Up of Learning How to Learn Course
 
Welcome to the last video of Learning How To Learn.
If you're still listening to us, then you've come all the way through the course. And may remember at the beginning, I said that brains do not come with an instruction manual. So we have to write one ourselves. And that was one of our goals.
 
In this final video, we want to tell you how much we've enjoyed teaching and learning. We've learned from you as we hoped you've learned from us.
 
The truth is you've always been in the driver's seat when it comes to your own learning.
But now that you have a better feeling for what's under your neural hood, you can use this to help you learn new things all during your lifetime.
 
What we're hoping is that as the days and months will pass you'll continue to bring to mind some of the key ideas you've learned in the course.
 
Approaches such as switching your mode of thinking from focused to diffuse can help reduce your frustration and allow for more creative problem solving.
 
Strengthening your chunking can give you a firmer grasp of the material. Even seemingly tiny changes in your daily approach to your work.
 
Using the pomodoro technique, for example, can make a dramatic long-term difference in your learning and in your ultimate success.
 
Learning is so vitally important to our future that most of us spend 12 to 16 of our earliest years of our lives in school, culminating in high school or college. But the focus in formal education is on the product of learning, not the process of learning.
 
In this course, we've tried to give you a better sense of the learning process.
Although this is our last video, we hope it's not our last chance to influence you.
 
You have not truly learned something unless you can teach it to others. Teach those ideas to others and you will find that they will continue to resonate and deepen in your own mind.
 
We hope you'll also have discovered how powerful these ideas can be at helping you broaden your
interest, passion, and expertise.
 
Many people believe that what they're initially, sort of, naturally good at is what they're supposed to be doing in life. But I myself am living proof that passions can broaden, change, and grow.
 
The world is evolving and a broad toolkit that allows you to learn effectively in many different subject areas is one of the most powerful assets you can have.
